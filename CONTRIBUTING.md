## Commits

You can run `yarn cz` instead of `git commit` to get an interactive prompt for
creating commit messages.

- We use [Angular's commit guidelines] for our commit messages.
- We use [validate-commit-message] to enforce it. Start your commit with `WIP`
  to skip validation (you should squash/rebase these commits before merging).

[angular's commit guidelines]: https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/DEVELOPERS.md#-git-commit-guidelines
[validate-commit-message]: https://github.com/conventional-changelog-archived-repos/validate-commit-msg
